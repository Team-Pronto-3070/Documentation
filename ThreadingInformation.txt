Threading is what we use to circumvent problems with a single
teleopPeriodic method.

For example, in the teleop method, we have our drive code 
and a function that enters a while loop to execute some
task. When we try to execute the while loop and drive at
the same time, all of the motor settings will be conserved
while the loop is executing, meaning that if we take
our hands off the controller while we are in the loop,
the robot will keep driving until it exits the while loop.

Threading essentially creates multiple teleopPeriodic
functions that run parallel to each other, so that
executing one function will run independent of all other
functions.

DISCLAIMER
Threading is not recommended as it puts greater strain on
the Roborio and has the possibilty of overloading and
freezing the Roborio. 

It is recommended to use State Machines for executing functions
instead of creating multiple Thread classes.
